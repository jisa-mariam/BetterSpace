# Welcome to BetterSpace !
BetterSpace is a mental health application targeted to connect youths suffering from mental health issues to mental health specialists, such as psychotherapists and counsellors. Through this application, my team hopes to reduce the stigmatization around seeking help for mental health. 

Similar to how we get regular check-ups at clinics and hospitals, my group hopes that young adults will tune in with their mental health regularly before it escalates.

## Research
Through the course of the project, we have conducted user interviews with many youths between the age of 18 to 25 to learn more about their mental and emotional well-being and how they cope with their problems.

The objective of those interviews with our target audience was to equip us with adequate knowledge that would enable us to empathise with their situation and design an app that best caters to their needs.

We also interviewed an expert who has been working with MSF to offer counselling services to generic and drug offenders between the age of 13 and 34.

Through the research done, we were able to obtain clarity on the assumptions we had about mental health such as how having a series of multiple-choice questions for the user assessment feature of the app may deter the users from seeking help.

## Final Prototype and Its Features
Our final prototype contains 2 main user flows the user could take when using the application:
1. The user is desperate for help and wishes to seek help from a counsellor immediately (shown in `BetterSpace User Flow 1.mp4` or [here](https://youtu.be/YG8sbH3PXXU))
2. The user would like to take his/her time to answer a few questions in order to find the counsellor that could cater to his/her needs the most (shown in the `BetterSpace User Flow 2.mp4` or [here](https://youtu.be/xaF9Y9gsAJ4))

The only difference between User Flow 1 and User Flow 2 is whether the user chooses to do questionnaire or chooses to chat with a counsellor directly. The rest of the user journey (shown in `BetterSpace Home Page.mp4` or [here](https://youtu.be/HCow7Y9P130)) is the same for both user flows.

Now, let's talk a little more about the other features of this application.
1. If the user chooses to go through user flow 2 where they answer a questionnaire to find the most suitable counsellor, the user will be given the option to choose a different counsellor from the one that was allocated to them by the AI.
2. During the interviews with the youths, a few of them mentioned that security was very important to them as they did not want others to read their conversations with the counsellors. Hence, we have introduced an option for the users to set a passcode that will need to be entered every time they wish to chat with the counsellor.
3. During chat sessions, in order to prevent abuse of the feature, the call buttons will be disabled until it is time for the user's appointment with the counsellor. By doing so, it prevents the users from spam calling the counsellors and will respect the work schedule of the counsellors. If the user has not booked an appointment yet, clicking on the disabled call buttons will prompt him/her to book an appointment with the counsellor. Appointments can also be booked directly from the Home page.
4. In this application, there is also an exercise feature where counsellors will be able to give online ‘homework’ in the form of exercises to the users and the users will be reminded to do them. Examples of these exercises include journaling and meditation. This will also enable the counsellors to track the user’s progress more efficiently.
